# TheElectroencephalogramControlSystem
An electroencephalogram (EEG) control system provides a new unique way of controlling your everyday electronic devices by directly analyzing the signals in your brain and identifying action(s) you were intending to perform. Utilizing the sensors on this EEG, the signal analysis done with device, and external software, it is now possible to command external devices (such as motors, actuators, etc) based upon the signals analyzed from your brain. This project demonstrates this capability using MUSE, a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) EEG headband with Java Middleware to determine the physical actions being commanded to external electronic devices and to execute those actions. This project is an example of an interdisciplinary project combining the fields of signal analysis, S/W Java programming, and(eventually) embedded device engineering.
